# i18n-sample
A React internationalization barebone sample bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and `react-language-kit`

## Overview

This app is a showcase of [react-language-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-language-kit).<br>
Its based on create-react-app's stub files and modified the least amount necessary to include the i18n lib.

There is also a [live demo](https://i18n-sample.web.app) available.
